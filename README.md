# Hello, This is Umer Ali 👋
I am a highly motivated and skilled DevOps Engineer with 3+ years of experience, strong capabilities in cloud 
technologies, automation, CI/ CD, container orchestration, and modern infrastructure tools. I specialize in Docker, 
Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, ArgoCD, and monitoring solutions such as Prometheus, Grafana, and 
CloudWatch. 

I have strong knowledge of cloud architecture, scripting, configuration management, and continuous delivery 
practices. I enjoy creating automated, reliable, and secure systems that support high- performance applications. 

I am a fast learner with excellent problem-solving abilities, strong communication skills, and the ability to collaborate 
effectively with cross-functional teams. My focus is always on improving efficiency, enhancing stability, and ensuring 
smooth and consistent delivery pipelines. 

I am committed to continuous learning, staying updated with modern DevOps trends, and contributing to scalable 
and efficient cloud platforms.
